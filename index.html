ABOUT
<br />
<br />
Pietu Tamminen (b.1981) is self thought multidisciplinary artist working mostly in Helsinki area. He´s personal practice 
focuses, with common subjects, using different low budget printing methods and consumer equipments with repetitive
technigues to small outruns. Expansive aesthetics in DIY culture combined with avantgardish way of seeing the actual 
processes as a part of the finished works. Artefacts related to modern reductive processes; the networks of different cause 
and effect positions. To see the essential and to keep he´s artistic processes flowing, simplicity in concepts and working 
mostly with easy printing methods been forming the basis in he´s daily practice. Hailing from 90s digital revolution, rooted 
as well more abstract rendition, he´s output with Galleria Muuttolaatikko project (that´ works on conceptual site-specific 
forms of contemporary art and public interventions), is more experimental approach to similar subjects and varies in abstracts 
as a connective meta-layer. To see the whole chain that interplay in the process and what makes the depth that is mounted in 
works, constructions as open processes supports the creative solutions.

Layered glances - Some thoughts on the photography of Pietu Tamminen<br />
<br />
A landscape, photographed through a dirty window, the sky, the wood and the ground blurred into near-monochromatic color fields, yet 
somehow distinguishable. What's in focus, however, is the window, speckled with raindrops. The image is pulsing, the out-of-focus 
landscape, trying to sharpen, does its best to draw attention away from the window, only to end up becoming even more blurred. 
Meanwhile something else catches the eye, a vague reflection of the photographer’s hands, barely noticeable against the ocher ground.
<br />
I thought I had found a typical photograph by Pietu Tamminen until I stopped at another one. A piece of scrap metal leaning against a 
concrete wall. This could also be a typical photo by the Helsinki-based artist. Or not. At first glance it might look like Tamminen's 
photos are so varied that it would make little sense to look for a common thread in them.
<br />
However, after spending some time looking through the pictures, one starts to notice the similarities in them. One aspect that stands 
out is Tamminen's use of surfaces with a two-dimensional pattern. Tiles, gratings and curtains are photographed perpendicular to the 
visual axis and become parts of collage-like compositions, making other objects in the picture appear as if they have been copy-pasted 
from different sources.
<br />
Sometimes these surfaces seem to slice through a space to disrupt a clean linear perspective. Sometimes they act as screens to cast 
shadows that demonstrate precisely how such representation of the three dimensions is achieved on a two-dimensional picture plane.
<br />
It should be obvious by now that there is no single effect that Tamminen is trying to achieve. Whenever similar elements appear in 
the photographs, they are juxtaposed with something else. But as long as all these juxtapositions remain in the back of one's head, they 
become a part of the pictures even where they are not present. They become a hidden layer of sorts, one that also serves as a 
contextual barrier.
<br />
Besides photography, Tamminen produces digital sketches that can be seen as visually expressing what verbal descriptions can't reach. 
Often strictly black and white with no grey tones, the sketches can serve as a guide for the viewer on how a staircase, for 
example, could be idealized as a rhythmic pattern, how its materiality creates variations in that rhythm, giving it a distinct texture and tone.
<br />
Knowing Tamminen's interest and work in music, it is hard not to see this as a musical allusion, but it goes beyond that. It goes 
to the drawing boards of anonymous industrial designers, architects and city planners whose work artists like Tamminen are constantly 
reframing. In a sense he invites us to follow such associative paths into infinity, but the image is always there to yank us back 
into its static presence.<br />
